# Hands on! 🖐 Maptime Mobile Mapping Workshop

This project includes three tasks to help you learn how to use Mapbox tools on mobile devices:

## Task #1: Beginning Mapbox Studio

Here you will learn how to work with the web-based Mapbox Studio interface to design your own custom map. After you complete task #1, choose either the **Android** and **iOS** platform track to continue.

### Create a Mapbox Account

- You will need to have a Mapbox account to start building. Head on over to [mapbox.com](https://account.mapbox.com/auth/signup/) to sign up.

### Design a new custom style

- *Go to Mapbox.com/studio to launch Mapbox Studio*
- Using this tutorial, create and publish a new custom [Mapbox Studio Style](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/create-a-custom-style/).
  - Alternatively, if you feel comfortable with Studio already or have an existing style you want to use, you can skip to tasks 2 and 3.
